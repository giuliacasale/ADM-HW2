# Homework 2 - eCommerce analytics

In this homework we are dealing with some datasets coming from an online store. These data describe entirely the months of October and November 2019. They can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store?select=2019-Oct.csv).

Our goal was to answer some research questions that would help the company to discover and interpret meaningful patterns in data and eventually increase the number of sales.

We organized our work into two main files:

1. `ADM-HOMEWORK2.ipynb` a Jupyter Notebook that contains all the answers to the questions for the homework, analyzed trough functions, datasets and plots

2. `methods.py` a Python file that contains the functions to read the datasets and combine them. There are also all the generalized functions that we then imported inside Jupyter to make the notebook clearer and to answer the questions.
